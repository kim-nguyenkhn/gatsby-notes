My personal tinkerings & notes with GatsbyJS. 

## Advantages to Gatsby, aka "Why Use Gatsby?"

You could use Gatsby anywhere you're using:
- Some CMS (Content Management System), such as WordPress.
- A static site generator, such as Jekyll
- A site builder, such as Squarespace. 

From the [GatsbyJS website itself](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/):

> Gatsby.js is a static PWA (Progressive Web App) generator. 
> 
> You get code and data splitting out-of-the-box. 
> 
> Gatsby loads only the critical HTML, CSS, data, and JavaScript so your site loads as fast as possible. 
> 
> Once loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so clicking around the site feels incredibly fast.
> 
> Instead of waiting to generate pages when requested, pre-build pages and lift them into a global cloud of servers â€” ready to be delivered instantly to your users wherever they are.

- Plenty of community support:
  - [Plugin Library](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/) to extend features
  - ["Starters"](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters), or boilerplates for projects
  - [External resources](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/awesome-gatsby/)

- Uses React, and GraphQL out of the box
